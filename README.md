MVC

Vanilla MVC design pattern

This is a design pattern I built to help myself learn MVC. It seems to be very functional however I am still learning more every day and constantly adding to it. You are welcome to look over it to further your knowledge of MVC, or to point out various flaws. You may also fork/copy/build upon it. I've found development MUCH more enjoyable after using this framework, mainly because of the speed it gives you once it's all setup. Have fun!
